# React Portfolio

## My React Site:

Welcome to my portfolio. This portfolio was built using react. I used a mobile first approach building this site to ensure that it's fully responsive on all device types.

I have utilised React-Router-DOM which enables me to implement dynamic routing.

All of the styling on this site has been implemented using Tailwind CSS. Tailwind CSS is a utility first CSS framework. This enables me to build the skeleton of my site with HTML and style inline.
